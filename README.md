# Morialkar's Advent of code

I'll try to do each day in a different language and provide a central tool to run each of them

## Global Requirements
To run any and all days, you will need a recent (17+) node version and Yarn installed on your machine.

You will also need to run the following command from the root:

`yarn install`

Every single day will have a script to run it, so you can called any day by simply running `yarn DAY` like so:

`yarn one`

## Day 1: Typescript

Day one doesn't require any external dependencies.
## Day 2: Ruby

To run Day 2, you will need to have a Ruby version higher than 2.7.0, and install the following gems:

`gem install bundler prettier_print syntax_tree syntax_tree-haml syntax_tree-rbs`

This will allow Prettier Ruby to work with the project.
